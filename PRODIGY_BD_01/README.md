## Basic REST API with CRUD Operations

### Description

Create an API with endpoints to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a users resource.

### Requirements

- Each user should have the following fields:
  - `id` (UUID)
  - `name`
  - `email`
  - `age`

- Use an **in-memory data structure** (such as a hashmap) for data storage.

- Ensure **proper HTTP status codes and error handling**, for example:
  - `404` for resource not found
  - `400` for bad requests

- Include **basic input validation**, such as:
  - Checking if the email format is valid
