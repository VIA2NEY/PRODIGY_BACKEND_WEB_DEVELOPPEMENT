# Task 04 – Caching with Redis

## Objective
Implement caching to optimize the performance of your API.

## Requirements

- Integrate **Redis** to cache the results of frequently accessed endpoints  
  *(e.g., fetching all users)*.
- Implement **cache invalidation strategies** when data changes  
  *(e.g., updating or deleting a user)*.
- Set **cache expiration** for certain data to ensure it stays fresh.
- Measure **performance improvements**  
  *(e.g., response times before and after caching)*.
